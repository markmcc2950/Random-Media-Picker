1. Select the "Select Media Path" button to select the directory you want to utilize. This directory should contain all video files you want it to pick from, whether that be a full TV show, a specific season, or a root folder that contains multiple TV shows and/or movies.
2. Select the "Watch Random" button. This will parse your paths, selecting random folders, and eventually random media when it reaches valid files to open.
3. When the media file finishes, VLC Media Player will automatically close, and you can end the program or pick another episode at this point.
4. Select the "Watch Continuous" button. This will repeat step 2 up to three times in a row. After three viewed episodes, the application will ask if you are still watching and give the user the choice to stop watching.
5. Select one of the three radio buttons of the bottom left: 10/25/50. These control how many recent episodes show in the large text field
6. Select one of the two radio buttons on the bottom right. These control the UI theme (current light mode/dark mode)
