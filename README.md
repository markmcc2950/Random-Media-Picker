1. Select the "Browse" button to select the directory you want to utilize. This directory should contain all video files you want it to pick from, whether that be a full TV show, a specific season, or a root folder that contains multiple TV shows and/or movies.
2. Select the "Generate" button. This will parse your paths, selecting random folders, and eventually random media when it reaches valid files to open.
3. When the media file finishes, VLC Media Player will automatically close, and you can end the program or pick another episode at this point.
